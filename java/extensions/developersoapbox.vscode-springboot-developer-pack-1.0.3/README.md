# Spring Boot Developer Extension Pack

This extension pack for Visual Studio Code adds useful extensions needed for effectively developing Spring Boot projects on Visual Studio code.  

The main purpose of this extension is to get a new Java / Spring Boot vscode environment up and running as quickly as possible.

Some of these extensions do require that you already have a JDK already setup in your system to properly function.
