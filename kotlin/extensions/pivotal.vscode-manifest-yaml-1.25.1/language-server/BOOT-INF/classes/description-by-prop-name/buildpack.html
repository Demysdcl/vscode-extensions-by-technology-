<p>If your application requires a custom buildpack, you can use the <code>buildpack</code> attribute to specify its URL or name:</p>

<pre>
---
  ...
  buildpack: buildpack_URL
</pre>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The <code>cf buildpacks</code> command lists the buildpacks that you can refer to by name in a manifest or a command line option.</p>

<p>The command line option that overrides this attribute is <code>-b</code>.</p>
