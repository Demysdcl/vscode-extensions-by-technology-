*Required* The path to the pipeline's configuration file.

file points at a .yml file containing the pipeline configuration, which allows this to be tracked with your resources or generated by a task step.

The first segment in the path should refer to another artifact from the plan, and the rest of the path is relative to that artifact.

**For example** Fetching and confifuring a pipeline

The `get` step can be used to fetch your configuration from a git repo and auto-configure it using a `set_pipeline` step:

```
- get: ci
- set_pipeline: my-pipeline
  file: ci/pipelines/my-pipeline.yml
```
