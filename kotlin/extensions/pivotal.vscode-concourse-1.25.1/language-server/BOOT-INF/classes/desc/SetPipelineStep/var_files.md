*Optional* A list of paths to .yml files that will be passed to the pipeline config in the same manner as the --load-vars-from flag to [fly set-pipeline](https://concourse-ci.org/setting-pipelines.html#fly-set-pipeline). This means that if a variable appears in multiple files, the value from a file that is passed later in the list will override the values from files earlier in the list.
